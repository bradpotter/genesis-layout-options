## Usage

Genesis Layout Options provides additional layouts to the Genesis Framework. Select from these new layouts just like you would from the built-in layouts. This plugin was created to work with the recently released [ThemeCore](https://github.com/bradpotter/themecore) theme. You may need to adjust the width settings in genesis-layout-options.css for your specific theme.
